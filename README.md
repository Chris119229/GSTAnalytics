# Project Title: GST Hackathon Hybrid Model

## Description
This project implements a hybrid machine learning model using Gradient Boosting and SVM for [briefly explain the problem you are solving, e.g., "predicting customer churn"]. The model is trained on [briefly describe the dataset used, e.g., "a dataset containing customer transaction data"].

## Features
- Hybrid model combining Gradient Boosting and SVM.
- Data preprocessing with scaling and label encoding.
- Prediction script to generate results based on new input data.
